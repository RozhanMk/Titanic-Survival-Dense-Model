# Titanic-Survival-Dense-Model
This repository contains the code for [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
I got a dense model with 78% accuracy in the competition. Also, I used a transformation pipeline for feature selection.
### My notebook in Kaggle is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rozhanmirzaei/dense-model-titanic-78-accuracy-with-pipeline). ###
